	Guiding Questions
		If these texts were our only sources of information, what would we learn about
		the Gulag and what it was like to work/live in the camps? 
			First, we learn that working for the USSR is mandatory, be it working in the camps (Gulag Boss) or living in the camp (One Day)
			We learn that the USSR imposed many strict rules on it's citizens - if Gulag Boss didn't bring his horse he would end up at the camp, One Day could only have so many articles of clothing
			
		What different perspectives do these sources offer us on life in the Gulag but
		also Soviet society? 
			Gulag Boss offers the perspective of getting the "opportunity" to serve the Soviet Union while One Day offers the view of having to work for the USSR
			Very modest society - 19
			
		Both works have silences in their narratives. What do you think the author
		leaves out and why? What are silences and what can they tell us? 
			Silences are...
			Largely, the Gulag Boss, never talks about the brutality faced by the prisoners
			Gulag Boss also somewhat glosses over how he was unfairly treated (being blamed for lost supplies) and doesn't talk bad about the USSR because of this
